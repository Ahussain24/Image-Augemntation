# Image-Augemntation

Data Augmentaion is the process where we artifically generate more samples from an already existing sample by apply various transformation.
Augmenting image data is no different. here we use Tensorflow imagedatagenerator class to genrate 4 image from one image by applying various image transformation technque 
such as rotating (vertical and horizonal),zooming, cropping,shear etc.

First Go to your kaggle account and download API token using which you can download any data from command line and scripts
After downloading the kaggle.json file put it inside the same as the python file, and run the all cells . the scripts will take care of that.

For any other dataset some change is  filneeded. feel free explore and tinker with file.
